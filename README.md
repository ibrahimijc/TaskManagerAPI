# TaskManagerAPI
An API for task manager api connected with mongodb using mongoose.


To run the project 
1) install mongodb on the local machine
2) run npm install
3) run mongodb
   Either by npm run db (but for this you'll have to change the path db in package.json and point it to your mongod file and dbpath
   to your desired folder for the database)
4) npm run dev
5) Test the endpoints with postman or however you like to test api's





It's still in progress.
